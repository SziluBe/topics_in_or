- parse list of rooms from XL
- parse list of times from XL (split days into e.g. 5 min slots between start and finish times in each day)
- parse list of weeks from XL
- generate representation of the solution in XL
- generate travel times between rooms
- NotOverlap and Precedence constraint generation -> suggest ways to automatically do this for courses
- get instructor data
- model instructors with SameAttendees constraints
- optional MaxDays constraint generatin for courses -> suggest ...
- generate student course selections for use plugged in as constraints in experiments
- find start time of days by data (earliest class)
- find end time of days similarly
- NOTE: week 9 in XL is Sem 1 Week 1 and there are 11 weeks, so week 19 is Sem 1 Week 11 (i.e. last week), week 26 in XL is Sem 2 Week 1 and week 37 is Sem 2 Week 11
- make tool to define course structures (configs) manually, and do this for all courses in the data
